## HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 Differences
The Hypertext Transfer Protocol, or HTTP, is an application protocol that has been the de facto standard for communication on the World Wide Web since its invention in 1989. 
HTTP 1.1 came out in 1997 and in 2015 HTTP 2 was released which offered several methods to decrease latency, especially when dealing with mobile platforms and server-intensive graphics and videos, it does it by compression of HTTP header fields, and add support for stream prioritization to minimize page load latency. 

**HTTP/2 does not modify the application semantics of HTTP in any way. All the core concepts, such as HTTP methods, status codes, URIs, and header fields, remain in place. Instead, HTTP/2 modifies how the data is formatted (framed) and transported between the client and server.**
